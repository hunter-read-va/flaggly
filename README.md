Project for evaluating candidates on code understanding, ability to review code, and architecting improvements.

This is not representative of an enterprise application, and does not include testing, hard codes values, and is not scalable. **It is only meant for ease and speed of understanding the codebase.**

## Backend

Change to the backend folder with `cd backend`  
Run application with `quarkus dev`  
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/` to get to the Swagger ui.  

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Next.js. Follow these instructions to get started using Node 18: https://nodejs.org/en
